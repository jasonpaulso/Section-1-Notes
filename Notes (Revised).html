		<h1>Intro to Programming: Stage One </h1>

		<div>
			<p id="intro">It's easy to think that The Internet just works, but as one begins to delve into the actual work that IS the internet, what becomes increasingly clear is that it is actually quite complex - not to mention incredibly 
			interesting!</p>

  			<h3 class="subject-title">The Internet</h3>

			<div class="content">
				<p><b>The Internet</b> is, in the most simple terms, a vast world-wide network of computers (including an innumerable quantity of computers masquerading as phones, televisions, refrigerators, etc) which communicate using a protocol called HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.) Basically, this is the means by which the internet sends and receives data between the user and the server.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="subject-title">HTML</h3>

			<div class="content">
				<p>We all know communication between other people would be very difficult without language, well the same goes for our devices. While there are nearly as many computer languages as there are us languages, the most common language of the internet is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language.)</p>

				<p>Our devices take take our input and requests and sends this information to the server. The server in turn accepts our input, locates the corresponding information or content, and then sends it to our device using HTML. The HTML contains the content (i.e. text, photos, videos, etc) as well as specific instructions about how it is to be displayed.</p>

			</div>

			<h3 class="subject-title">The Elements of HTML</h3>

			<div class="content">
				<p>The language of HTML is made up primarily of Elements and Tags. HTML documents tell our browsers what to display and how to displaying by providing specific instructions within tags, like when a paragraph begins or ends, when the font should be bold or italicized, and more often it tells the browser to refer to a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet - more later) for more detailed instructions about the formatting of content. The collection of tags and details between them make up an element.</p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="subject-title">Elegance In / Elegance Out or Garbage In / Garbage Out</h3>

			<div class="content">
				<p>So, now that we know the a little about what happens behind the scenes it's important to know a bit about how these things come about.</p> 

				<p>The secret is; computers are stupid, even so-called smartphones are stupid! That's because without programmers they would be useless and inert. In order to make a computer <em>compute</em> it has to be given instructions. And those instructions have to be very, very, very specific. Any computer language, HTML included, has to be structured and detailed so that the computer has no question about any element, because computers cannot infer and this can cause our content to be confused, confusing, or just plain <em>garbage</em>.</p>

			<h3 class="subject-title">The Basic Structure of HTML</h3>

			<div>

				<p class="content">HTML documents are generally divided into boxes. These are called "block elements." Block elements literally place the information the contain or produce into boxes, visible or not,which are stacked and sorted according to the programmers instructions. When displayed in a browser, block elements generally start and end with a new line.</p>

				<p class="content">Another type of element is the "inline element." Inline elements usually do not break the page or line and most often defines a section or subsection within a block element.</p>

			</div>

			<h3 class="subject-title">Planting a Tree</h3>

			<div class="content">

				<p>The ideal structure - and if you ask most programmers, the only structure - for stacking and sorting these elements will resemble a tree. This means that the code for a web document branches or webs out from the most central page level up (or down) to further and further more specific instructions. This can be seen as elements within elements or boxes within boxes.</p> 

				<p>More specifically "tree-like" is the way that an HTML document reads as text or code. Here you will see elements branching (indenting) in from another and another, etc. The further an element is indented the "higher" it is in the tree - or the deeper it is nested within other boxes.</p>

			</div>

			<h3 class="subject-title">The Color of the Leaves</h3>

			<div class="content">

				<p>While the basic structure of an HTML document is clearly vital to making a usable and understandable piece of content, without styling the web would be completely unrecognizable as it is today and wouldn't be very visually appealing. The primary method of styling an HTML document is by using CSS. Separate from the HTML document a CSS document contains specific instructions for each type of element within the web page. Instructions such as font-family, font-size, placement of the "boxes," or whether a hyperlink is blue, green, or changes between the two when interacted with.</p>

				<p>One of the benefits of using CSS for styling a document, as opposed to using styling code within the HTML document is that it allows the programmer to avoid a lot of repetition. We can enter the styling code for each type of element just once and then place references within the HTML document as needed. Without CSS it would take exponentially more time and effort to develop a dynamic and appealing web page (even the code itself would probably be ugly!)</p>
